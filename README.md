I offer no support whatsoever for this. Use at your own risk. I license it under the same license as AnkiDroid.

If you are interested in this, please write about it here: https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/js-api-discussion/44907 . Because as long as nobody is using this anyway, I will be pretty careless with breaking changes and probably forget to push my updates to GitHub.
